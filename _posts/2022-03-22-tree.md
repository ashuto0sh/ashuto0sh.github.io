<h2 style="color:grey;"> To the tree in my backyard </h2>

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/27_03_22/landscape.jpg)

The cool west wind blows, while I sit beside my old confidante, _calm_

Listening to my wits, it overreacts a lot

Excited when I tell him about you, sways even
_Drama_, but I blush all the same


It has grown with me, outgrown me even, _majestic_

And I wonder if it got company, when I am away

I wish I could be here more, I wish it wasnâ€™t as complicated

But I am sure it understands, _life_

A soft purple weed has now grown by its side


I shall see you soon, _old friend_
